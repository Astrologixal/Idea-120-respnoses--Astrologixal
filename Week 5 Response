Spooked and considering how spooky deer are 

WHat I'm about to write is going to be a little less formal and more just in my head because with a peom I feel as though it's more of an expressive writing so I'd
rather write that way when It somes to this reading. After reading this poem, I actually kind of liked it. I feel like by using the method Flarf, it made the peom 
sound more poetic, as cliche as that is. There key word to me was spooky and ghost, I kept seeing that come up in every single fraction of the poem. It kind of 
made me think more about the poem itself, and how these random words can really turn out to be something. In highschoo;, I was in spoken word for 3 years and when I 
do write as far as a story, a piece, or just a regular poem I feel like I'm pretty good at it and I honestly also like it. Nontheless, I really enjoyed reading 
this piece and the poem itself made me think not only about it but also about the endless ideas and things there are to create. Before I read this poem I had no
idea flarf existed but I am glad I do know now because i feel like its just another tool I learned to write and to view the world differently.
