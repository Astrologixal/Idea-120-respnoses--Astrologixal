Rise of the Video Game

  In the beginning of the reading the author Anna Anthropy makes it pretty clear that she has a problem with video games. Anthropy argues that not only does
she not like video games but other people dont like them as well. She then goes into explaining that newscasters have reported that videosgames not only 
desensitize children to violence but also teaches them to steal, kill, etc. Because videogames are on consoles, phones, tablets, computers it gives 
predators more access to manipulate and steal children. 

"People condemn videogames because videogames are prevasive in popular culture. They're on our computers, on our cell phones, in our purses and pockets". 
technology is so immersive in todays society that in my personal opinion we will never devolove, there is going to be something thats continually added,
and new trends that are started. 

  Kapos then goes into to talk about the dynamic of todays videogames how they are mainly based on shooting eachother and to see who survives, and who can
  steal the most, etc. we arent learning anything by playing these games unless of course, a zombie apoclypse is in the cards. "Right now we can imagine
  where creating a game is as easy as writing a story or drawing a picture. We can imagine videogames that are written, like NewGrounds suggests, "by everyone"
  for everyone, rather than by corporations for consumers or by technical wizards for stunned onlookers. This is our time, and games are ours to create. 
  so what are games good for?". This was her closing statment and I feel like she made a really good and strong argument with a pretty good soultuon.
