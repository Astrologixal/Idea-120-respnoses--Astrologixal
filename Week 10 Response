Video Games for humans 

  Merrit Kopas introdcues in the beginning by giving a background story in how Twine had changed his life. He goes on to talk about his twenties and how during
that time he was disassociating from his writing. After playing a Twine games for the very first time he was conflicted with never have seen such a game 
where he felt like the authors emersed themsevles giving off the feeling that they were there with you. For the very first time Kopas felt apart of a world
that he could understand more than the actual one he was living in. He continues to read stories and eventually found the courage to write his own. In that
story he wrote it was a two player game for a companion he was with at the time, but that wasn't the last time that he would use Twine to write a story as 
a gift. 

  He continued to write and write and was really enojoying it, even using the words "Most importantly, I was able to share these works with other people like 
  me. Twine brought me into a network of people who made games outside of the mainstream". After using the tool for a while Kapos started to run workshops at
  schools, confreences,and community spaces. Kapos found an outlet that ended up becoming part of his everydya life where he actually enjoyed the work he did
  I aspire to be like that one day
  
  
  A quote I liked that Kapos used is "but the thing about artistic revolutions is that people keep working long after the mainstream has moved on to its next
  facination". This resonated with me because as an artisit myself I do agree that todays world is all about trends and whats going to blow up next, and they 
  end as fast as they start, and then society is n to the next fresh new thing but for some reason I focus on one thing til im finished and then continue.
