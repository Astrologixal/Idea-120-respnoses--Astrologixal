 Entangled: Technology and the Transformation of Performance
 
I've noticed that in every single reading so far, a certain date has been shown to have changed everything throughout history. In this case, August 13, 1876 
was the day to which thousands of Europe's and America's royalty, artists, and critics made their pilgrimage to witness a spectacle of historical proportion. 
This spectacle of historical proprotion was an "extraordinary theatre experience in which people could come view a four evening long music drama, about the develop-
ment of cultural history". "The Viennese music critic Edwaurd Hanslick announced "an extraoridanry musical theatrical experience and much more! This four-evening-long
music drama is a remarkable development in cultural history, not to mention the construction of a special theatre solely for its production and the pilgrimage
of thousands of persons from half of Europe to this remote, half-forgtton little town whos name is now inedibly recorded int he history of art."

This reading was more so about music but it still had the pattern of an epiphany or invention that has put a mark on the world, history, and how we view things
such as art, music, photography, etc.
