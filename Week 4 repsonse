Media Hot and Cold

In this reading, we are learning about how the Waltz affected dance culture throughout history. We first start off with the argument that the reason that there was
a rise of the waltz was because of the "longing truth, simplicity, closeness to nature, and primitivism, which the last two thirds of the eighteenth century 
fufilled ". There are a lot of comparisons in this reading to show that there is a difference between hot and cold and the affects it has on media in the 22nd 
century. "There is a basic principle that distinguises a hot medium like radio from a cool one like the telephone, or a hot medium like the movie from a cool one
like television". There is always a difference between such similar things and thats when hot and cold does come into play. "With print many earlier forms were 
excluded from life and art, and many were given strange new intensity. But our own time is crowded with examples of the principle that the hot form excludes and
the cool on includes". One of the examples that were given in there reading was that a hot medium is less participation than a cool one, while a lecture makes for
less participation than a seminar, and a book for less than dialogue.
