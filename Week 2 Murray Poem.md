Last message: Add me back to the global groupchat? I wanna play uno

Uno, can I ever win?

Global groupchats become a regular when 24 people text goodmorning and goodnight 
I distanced myself because these probalems aren't global they internally hurt me 
We play uno everyday, but what do I do when life yet again makes me draw 4?
Hoping that I can win at this game called life, am I competeing for it?
These messages and games sooth the thoughts reversing like counter clock work. 
Hoping one day I have one card left and I finally get to rest knowing the game has ended and I won.
